        <p><big>Web designing is a crucial aspect of developing websites and enhancing your skills.
             Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
             Other web design areas include graphic web design, user interface design authoring, standardised code and proprietary software, user experience design, and search engine optimization.
             "Website design  is concerned with both the site's usability and its aesthetic. 
             The layout and color scheme, for instance, are two facets of the website's appearance where the  web designer  would concentrate.
             Their goal? To create a website that's visually appealing and digestible.Ultimately,  good website design  seeks to score high points for user experience.
             A site with successful web design offers aesthetically pleasing features, is easy to navigate, feels intrinsic to the brand, and fits the customer base.
             Because web design is so focused on the  visual aspects  of the user interface and experience, web designers traditionally produce or work with deliverables such as storyboards, logo design, format, UI & UX design, and color palettes."
